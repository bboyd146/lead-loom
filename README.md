- Business owner notifications on new leads  
- Works with standalone forms or embedded workflows  
- Fully responsive frontend UI

## 🔁 System Flow

1. A customer submits a lead form  
2. Zapier detects the new submission  
3. Automated follow-up messages are sent instantly  
4. The business owner receives a real-time notification  

This ensures leads are contacted while they are still engaged, reducing response time and improving conversion rates.
